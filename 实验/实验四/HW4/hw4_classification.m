%% ================================classification==========================
% In this part, you need to perform classification with two different methods:
%    KNN and linear classification. 

% ********************************************KNN**************************************
% First, please using KNN to perform classification. In this section, you
% are required to compare the classification accuracies with different values of K. 
% Suggested values are [1 3 5 10];











% *********************************Linear Classifier***********************
% Plear use Linear Classifier to perform classification.
